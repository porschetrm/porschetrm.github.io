    <h3>ABOUT PORSCHE CARRERA GT</h3>
    <p class="description">Porsche Carrera GT
Ten years after production of the Carrera GT ended, it became a member of the Classic family. Built from 2003, the 980's appearance and stature left no question that it had motorsport in its DNA.

While its design displayed its stylistic relationship to the production vehicles, it combined this with the hallmarks of legendary Porsche racing vehicles.


Built as an exclusive run of only 1,270 vehicles, the Carrera GT was powered by a ten-cylinder engine with dry sump.

The naturally aspirated 5.5-litre V10 engine, which was actually designed for racing, had its displacement increased to 5.7 litres for the series.

Producing 450 kW (612 PS) of power at 8,000 rpm and with a top speed of over 330 km/h (205 mph), the Carrera GT truly set the benchmark.

The driving force was delivered via a manual six-speed transmission.</p>
